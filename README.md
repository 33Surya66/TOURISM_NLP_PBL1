# TOURISM_NLP_PBL1

Tourism Recommendation System using Stanford CoreNLP
Overview
This project implements a tourism recommendation system using Stanford CoreNLP, a suite of natural language processing tools. The system analyzes user queries related to tourism and provides recommendations based on the parsed information.

Features
Natural Language Understanding: Utilizes CoreNLP's capabilities to parse and understand user queries.
Recommendation Generation: Recommends tourist destinations, activities, or accommodations based on user preferences.
Interactive Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting queries and viewing recommendations.
Integration with External Data: Can integrate with external databases or APIs to fetch real-time information about tourist spots.
Requirements
Java 8 or higher
Stanford CoreNLP library (included in the project)
[Optional] Database or API for real-time data integration
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tourism-recommendation-system.git
cd tourism-recommendation-system
Compile the project:

bash
Copy code
javac -cp ".:path/to/stanford-corenlp/*" TourismRecommendationSystem.java
Replace path/to/stanford-corenlp/ with the actual path to your Stanford CoreNLP library.

Run the system:

bash
Copy code
java -cp ".:path/to/stanford-corenlp/*" TourismRecommendationSystem
Usage
Launch the application.
Enter your tourism-related query (e.g., "Recommend places to visit in Paris for a weekend").
The system will process the query using CoreNLP and display recommendations based on parsed information.
